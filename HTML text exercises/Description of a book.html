      This is the tale of <u>Harry Potter</u> (Daniel Radcliffe), an
      <b><i>ordinary</i></b> <b><i>eleven-year-old</i></b> boy serving as a sort
      of slave for his aunt and uncle who learns that he is actually a wizard
      and has been invited to attend the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and
      Wizardry. Harry is snatched away from his mundane existence by Rubeus
      Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), the groundskeeper for Hogwarts, and quickly
      thrown into a world completely foreign to both him and the viewer.
      <b><i>Famous</i></b> for an incident that happened at his birth, Harry
      makes friends easily at his new school. He soon finds, however, that the
      wizarding world is far more dangerous for him than he would have imagined,
      and he quickly learns that not all wizards are ones to be trusted. Fiction
